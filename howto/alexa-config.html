                        To get started the following things need to be done:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To have Alexa devices already configured or create a configuration using either the adapters like ioBroker.iot, ioBroker.devices or manually.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Activate and link the <code>iwg-vpn skill</code> to your ioBroker installation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            That's it :)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Please note, that the skill sends your Alexa commands to your ioBroker installation via the VPN. Even if you're not considering to use the remote access or NAT provided by the <code>ioBroker.iwg-vpn</code> adapter, you still have
                        to install WireGuard at least on your ioBroker host and set up the adapter as described
                        <a href="read-me.html"> here</a> to control your devices via Alexa.
                    </p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>The adapter doesn't provide any means to configure the devices. If you already use the ioBroker.iot adapter to control your devices via Alexa, then you already have the devices configured and the existing
                        configuration will be applied. If you want to start from scratch, then use any adapter of your choice, e.g. ioBroker.iot, ioBroker.devices or configure the devices manually by creating the corresponding states.
                        In case of a manual configuration, please follow the description of the required states for different device types of

                    <p>
                        You can activate the skill using your Alexa app or via Amazon Web-Site. In this example we'll do it via the Web-Site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Navigate to the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B2PHFX13">iwg-vpn Alexa skill</a> page, login with your Amazon account (the account your registered your Alexa with) if required and hit <code>Aktivieren</code>. This will take
                        you to the account linking page where you should log in using the credentials generated for you in the adapter UI (click on the link icon right to the iwg-vpn header):

                    <h2>
                        Background Info
                    </h2>
                    <h3>
                        Alexa Device Discovery
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Before a device can be controlled by an Alexa voice assistant, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Alexa Service requires the information about available Alexa capable devices.
                        This is implemented by sending a so-called Discovery request. The response to the Discovery request has to be in a pre-defined format.
                        <p/>
                        This format significantly differs from how the devices are represented in ioBroker. Furthermore, the current ioBroker approach
                        allows you to create and modify ioBroker states related to Alexa devices at many places by means of different adapters as well as manually.
                        Currently, the ioBroker.iot adapter has a not intuitive logic to collect all the related information and compose a response Alexa expects during the device discovery.
                        <p/>
                        This adapter's main goal is to provide a free of charge drop-in replacement for ioBroker.iot adapter. This means that you should be able to use exactly the same
                        device configuration. Unfortunately, the ioBroker.iot adapter doesn't expose the Alexa devices, so that this adapter has to implement the same logic to collect
                        the configured Alexa devices on its own. Furthermore, any future changes in ioBroker.iot logic have to find their way into this adapter as well.
                        <p/>
                        To provide the best user experience and react to changes and bugs promptly the device collection logic is implemented in the Alexa Skill, not in the adapter.
                        This allows to fix the bugs much faster without the need to publish and roll out a new version of the adapter. For this purpose the information related to device
                        discover is published to the Skill, this includes only the <i>common</i> and <i>type</i> properties of the relevant ioBroker states.
                     </p>

                    <h3>
                        State change reporting
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        This adapter implements Alexa API V3.
                    <p/>
                        Alexa API V3 introduced a lot of changes, one of these - proactive state change reporting. State change reporting means that every state change on an Alexa device
                        is reported to AWS Alexa Service so that the devices' states in the Alexa App are always up-to-date, and you can implement/configure scenes or routines that are triggered
                        on a state change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you might want to close your windows' shutters every time you turn the lights on. Sending the lights' state to the AWS Alexa service will
                        close the shutters even if you turn the light on manually, not via the Alexa App or voice command.
                    <p/>
                    <p>
                        To support this feature the adapter subscribes to state changes and sends the acknowledged ones to the Skill.
                    <p/>

                    <h3>
                        Why is the Skill free of charge?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The adapter and the Alexa Skill were designed and implemented in an efficient manner. For example, the Skill caches the last known states sent to the AWS Alexa Service,
                        so that every time the AWS Alexa Service requests the current state of a device, and believe me, the Alexa service sends a LOT OF request to obtain the current values,
                        the Skill can immediately respond. This avoids the unnecessary round trips to your ioBroker installation, reduces the execution time and at the end the infrastructure costs.
                        This and many other optimizations allow to keep the costs low and provide the functionality to you for free.
