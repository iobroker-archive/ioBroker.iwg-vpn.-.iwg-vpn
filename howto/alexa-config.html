                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        To get started the following things need to be done:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Get a basic understanding of Alexa concepts
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Configure controllable via Alexa devices
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Activate and link the <code>iwg-vpn skill</code> to your ioBroker installation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            That's it :)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Please note, that the skill sends your Alexa commands to your ioBroker installation via the VPN. Even if you're not considering to use the remote access or NAT provided by the <code>ioBroker.iwg-vpn</code> adapter, you still have
                        to install WireGuard at least on your ioBroker host and setup the adapter as described
                        <a href="read-me.html"> here</a> to control your devices via Alexa.
                    </p>


                    <h2>
                        Alexa Concepts
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        This is pretty easy. Every device Alexa can control has to respond to Alexa requests and commands in a certain way. As Alexa cannot talk directly to your local devices, and your devices probably don't respond to Alexa requests properly, a proxy is required,
                        which accepts the Alexa requests, translates them into the commands the local devices understand and replies back to Alexa. An Alexa skill in general and the <code>iwg-vpn skill</code> in particular is a
                        such proxy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Every Alexa device has to announce so called <code>capabilities</code> it supports. Every device supports at least one capability. This is how Alexa knows which commands can be sent to a device. For example, if a device supports
                        <code>switch</code> capability, Alexa knows that the device can be turned ON and OFF.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While sending a request or a command to a proxy, i.e., to a skill, Alexa also sends a unique identifier of a device, the command should be forwarded to, and a unique identifier of a linked account, the command was issued by. The linked account represents
                        your ioBroker installation. This is how the skill knows the exact destination of the command. The <code>Account Linking</code> is done by activiation of the skill with a unique set of credentials assigned
                        to your ioBroker installtion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even if it sounds a bit complicated rigth now, don't worry. Almost everything is done behind the scenes by the skill. This is what it is supposed to do :) The rest is described below.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Device Configuration
                    </h2>

                    <p>As mentioned, Alexa has to know which devices are available in your ioBroker installation and which capabilities they support.</p>

                    <p>
                        To open device configuration navigate to <code>&lt;your ioBroker IP&gt;:51822/iwg-alexa-config.html</code>
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-start.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                        <figcaption>
                            Device Configuration
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Initially there are no devices. To add a new device hit the
                        <code>+</code> button. A device with the name "New Device" is added. Change the name of the device to a desired one and select the corresponding Alexa display category(ies):
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-name.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        If you try to save the configuration now, you get the error message saying "A device must have at least one capability".
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-no-caps.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        So let's open the combobox and add the capabilites the <code>Hauptlicht</code> device supports. In this example we just select the <code>switch</code> capability to be able to turn the light ON and OFF via Alexa.
                    </p>


                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-caps.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        When you finish adding the capabilities and close the combobox, the selected capabilites are added to your device and can be configured. Expand the <code>switch</code> capability panel to open the configuration. Some capabilities
                        have pre-defined values the Alexa sends to a device. So the <code>switch</code> capability with pre-defined values <code>ON</code> and <code>OFF</code>. Here we have to provide two things: first, which ioBroker state should a value
                        be written to, and second - the values mapping, i.e. which value should be written in case the Alexa sends the value <code>ON</code> and which - in case the Alexa sends the value <code>OFF</code>. This mapping is also used to report
                        the values to Alexa on Alexa request. A value currently the ioBroker state is set to will be converted to either <code>ON</code> or <code>OFF</code>, according to the mapping, and then reported to Alexa.

                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-switch.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        If a capabilty doesn't have any pre-defined values, the mapping is not required. E.g., in case of the <code>dimmer</code> capability Alexa sends values between 0 and 100 to adjust brightness of a device. In this case the value
                        will be written as is into the selected ioBroker state.

                    </p>


                    <p>
                        To select an ioBroker state the values should be written to just click on the search icon and choose a state:

                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-select-state.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        To define the mapping - type the values directly into the table. Once done, you should get something like this:

                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/device-config-switch-end.png" loading="lazy">
                        </p>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Please ensure, that the type of the selected state corresponds to the type of values defined in the mapping. Also be aware, that if a state value cannot be converted to an Alexa pre-defined value or vice versa due to a missing or a wrong mapping, Alexa
                        will complain about that :)

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's it! The configuration of the <code>Hauptlicht</code> is finished and can be persisted. Press the save icon, confirm the warning and ensure the success confirmation appears:

                    </p>

                        Next step is skill activation and account linking.

                        You can activate the skill using your Alexa app or via Amazon Web-Site. In this example we'll do it via the Web-Site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Navigate to the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0B2PHFX13">iwg-vpn Alexa skill</a> page, login with your Amazon account (the account your registered your Alexa with) if required and hit <code>Aktivieren</code>. This will take
                        you to the account linking page where you should login using the credentials generated for you in the device configuration UI (click on the link icon in the upper-right conner to display the credentials):
