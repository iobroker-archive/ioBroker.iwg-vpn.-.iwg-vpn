                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is a VPN implementation that was recently added to the Linux kernel. It is faster and simpler than other popular VPN implementations like OpenVPN or IPsec.
                    </p>

                    <p>This adapter helps to easily set up an own Wireguard-based VPN and connect to a local ioBroker and local network from everwhere and any remote device. And all this can be done just in a minute.</p>

                    <p>Please be aware that at the moment the adapter is supported on Linux hosts only. If you run ioBroker on a Windows machine watch out for upcoming releases.
                    </p>

                    <h1>
                        Overview
                    </h1>

                    <p>To set up a VPN, we need at least two devices that we want to connect. One of these is the device hosting the ioBroker. The other device could be a smartphone or a computer on another local network.</p>

                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/overview.png" loading="lazy">

                            Connectivity overview
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        None of the devices is required to have a public IP address or to be reachable from the internet. No ports are required to be opened on your local network router. But, to be able to connect to each other via the VPN, the devices have to be properly set
                        up.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Installing Wireguard
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Every device on the VPN must have the WireGuard up and running. You can install WireGuard on your ioBroker host manually following the instructions on the official WireGuard <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">Installation</a>                        page. Alternativelly, you can run a shell script which will simplify the installation and make your life easier.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To install the WireGuard using the script, open the shell and exeute the commands:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>cd /opt/iobroker</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>sudo bash node_modules/iobroker.iwg-vpn/scripts/iwg-install.sh</code>
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Granting permissions to ioBroker
                    </h2>

                    <p>The WireGuard package installs two binaries:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>wg</code> — a tool for managing configuration of WireGuard interfaces
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>wg-quick</code> — a convenience script for easily starting and stopping WireGuard interfaces
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To be able to set up the WireGuard network interface, the ioBroker needs to execute WireGuard's <code>wg</code> and <code>wg-quick</code> commands with elevated privileges. Exactly the same way as today the ioBroker configured
                        to execute commands like <code>systemctl start</code> or <code>apt-get</code> without providing the sudo password, we have to add to this configuration the commands required to manage WireGuard interface.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can add these commands manually via, e.g., touching a file under
                        <code>/etc/sudoers.d/</code> and configuring it using <code>visudo</code> or you can download and run the script that will do it for you. To make the configuration via the script open the shell and execute the commands:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>cd /opt/iobroker</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>sudo bash node_modules/iobroker.iwg-vpn/scripts/iwg-config.sh</code>
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        ioBroker Configuration
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        This is the easiest part. The <code>iobroker.iwg-vpn</code> adapter automatically creates a configuration at start up. To verify that everything works as expected check the adapter connection status:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <img src="./img/adapter-connection-status.png" loading="lazy">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once connected, the adapter gets a private IP address and assigns it to the local WireGuard network interface. Starting from this point the ioBroker host is reachable in VPN under this IP address. You can always see the private IP address of your ioBroker
                        host in the <code>Objects</code> screen of the ioBroker:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="./img/local-address.png" loading="lazy">
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Setting up peers
                    </h2>

                    <p>Let's call the other devices on your VPN peers. The ioBroker host and the peers are devices on the same VPN.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once configured, the adapter not only gets its own IP address, it also gets 3 additional IP addresses to be used by the peers. Before adding a peer to your VPN you have to install the WireGuard package or the WireGuard app also on this peer. Please follow
                        the instructions on the official WireGuard <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/">Installation</a> page matching to the operating system of the peer. If your peer running a Linux, you can use the same
                        installation script as for the ioBroker host.
                    </p>

                    <p>To encrypt and decrypt network packets, we need keys. Once the WireGuard is installed on a peer, the key paar has to be generated. The private key will be used to decrypt incomming network packets and must be never revealed. The public
                        key will be used to encrypt the network packets sent towards the peer. The encrypted with a public key network packets can be only decrypted using the private key from the same key pair.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please use the installed app on a mobile device (peer) to generate the key pair. On a peer running Linux use the command:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey</code>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This command will create the keys and store them in <code>privatekey</code> and <code>publickey</code> files and print the publickey to stdout. You will need both keys later for configuration, so print also the privatekey to stdout:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <code>cat privatekey</code>
                    </p>

                            <code>IP</code> — The IP address you'd like to assign to the peer. The IP can be selected from a list of addresses in your VPN.

                            <code>Public Key</code> — The public key of the generated on the peer key pair. It will be used for network traffic encryption.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Active</code> — Only active peers are really available on VPN. You can configure more peers than IP addresses available, but only active ones with unique IP addresses will be added to your VPN. By switching this property
                            on and off you can add or remove a preconfigured peer to/from your VPN.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>

                        Now it's time for peers to join your VPN. If everything went well, the adapter has already created a config for every active peer. Open the <code>Objects</code> screen in the ioBroker, find the
                        <code>iwg-vpn</code> section and your active peers. Every peer object has an <code>address</code> state containing the assigned private IP address and the <code>config</code> state with prepared configuration.

                    <p>Copy the configuration string and paste it into a text editor. It looks like this:</p>

                    <p>
                        Replace the placeholder <code>&lt;private_key&gt;</code> with your peer's private key and place the whole content into a config file on the peer. For a mobile peer you can just paste the copied configuration into the iOS or Android
                        app, for a Linux peer create a file containing the configuration at
                        <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>.

                        Having the WireGuard installed and configuration file created, the VPN interface can be started on a peer. To start/stop the WireGuard on the mobile peer use the installed app, on a Linux peer use the command:
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Some words about security
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Security is an important aspect of any communication in generall and in this case even especially important. Please be aware that this adapter helps you to set up a communication channel and easily manage the WireGuard interface, but doesn't participate
                        in the communication itself. The entire communication is handled by the WireGuard. You can refer for the detailed description of how everything works and how the security is ensured to the WireGuard <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf">whitepaper</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You always control your VPN. Deleting all the peers or having no active peers configured makes your ioBroker host unreachable under the VPN address. Stopping the adapter will stop the WireGuard and remove the WireGuard network interface entirely.
